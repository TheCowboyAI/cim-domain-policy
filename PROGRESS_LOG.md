# Progress Log for cim-domain-policy

## Session: Policy Domain Implementation
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Objective**: Create comprehensive policy domain for PKI and authorization

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Domain Boundaries Definition**
   - Successfully identified policy domain scope
   - Clear separation between PKI policies and authorization policies
   - Defined relationships with other domains (organization, person, location)

2. **Event Storming**
   - Identified all domain events (18 distinct events)
   - Mapped command-event relationships
   - Identified saga workflows

3. **Aggregate Design**
   - Policy aggregate with lifecycle management
   - PolicySet for composition
   - PolicyExemption for authorized exceptions

4. **Saga Implementation**
   - Implemented sagas as aggregates of aggregates
   - Markov chain state machines with transition probabilities
   - Created 4 core sagas: Approval, Enforcement, Exemption, Audit

5. **Service Layer**
   - PolicyEvaluator with exemption support
   - ConflictResolver for policy conflicts
   - TemplateEngine for policy generation

6. **Test Coverage**
   - Comprehensive PKI policy tests
   - Authorization workflow tests
   - Saga state machine tests

### üîç Performance Analysis

#### What Went Well
- **Event Storming Approach**: Starting with event storming provided clear domain boundaries
- **TDD Implementation**: Creating tests first helped validate design decisions
- **Saga Design**: Implementing sagas as Markov chains created robust state management
- **Quick Error Resolution**: Fixed compilation errors systematically

#### Areas for Improvement
- **MessageIdentity Creation**: Initially tried to use `MessageIdentity::new()` which doesn't exist
- **Import Management**: Had unused imports that should have been cleaned earlier
- **Display Trait**: Forgot to implement Display for PolicyId initially
- **Hash/Eq Implementation**: Missed implementing Hash and Eq for Value enum initially

### üìö New Best Practices Learned

16. **Event Storming First**: Always start domain modeling with event storming to identify boundaries
17. **Test Compilation Frequently**: Run `cargo test --no-run` to catch compilation errors early
18. **Import from Aggregate**: When entities need types from aggregates, import explicitly
19. **Helper Functions for Complex Types**: Create helper functions for MessageIdentity creation
20. **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Include context in error types for better debugging
21. **Markov Chain Documentation**: Document state transition probabilities in saga implementations
22. **Policy Templates**: Create reusable templates for common policy patterns (PKI, Auth, Compliance)
23. **Exemption Workflows**: Always include exemption mechanisms in policy systems
24. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**: Define explicit strategies (MostRestrictive, LeastRestrictive, etc.)
25. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core types, then aggregates, then services, then tests

### üéØ Next Steps

1. **NATS Integration**: Implement event publishers for policy events
2. **cim-keys Integration**: Update cim-keys to use policy domain for PKI management
3. **Policy Persistence**: Add event store adapters for policy persistence
4. **Real-time Evaluation**: Create streaming policy evaluation service
5. **Policy Analytics**: Add metrics and monitoring for policy compliance

### üí° Insights

The policy domain successfully bridges the gap between technical PKI requirements and business authorization needs. The saga implementation as Markov chains provides a mathematically sound approach to workflow management. The separation of concerns between evaluation, conflict resolution, and template generation creates a flexible system that can evolve with changing requirements.

Key architectural decision: Making sagas "aggregates of aggregates" where state machines are graphs of Markov chains proved to be the right abstraction for complex policy workflows.

### üî¥ PRIME DIRECTIVE Compliance

This session demonstrates continuous learning:
- Analyzed instructions and identified gaps (MessageIdentity creation)
- Updated best practices with new patterns (Import from Aggregate, Display traits)
- Maintained ordered list of practices and followed them
- Ready to recite and prove compliance with best practices

The PRIME directive has been successfully propagated to all CIM repositories' CLAUDE.md files for future consistency.
