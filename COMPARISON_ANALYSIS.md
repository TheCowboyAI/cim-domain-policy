# Comparison Analysis: Local vs GitHub cim-domain-policy

## GitHub Version (Original Stub)

### Concepts Present
1. **Claims-Based Authorization** - Attribute-based access control
2. **Policy Templates** - Reusable policy patterns
3. **ResourcePattern** - Pattern matching for resources
4. **PolicyEffect** - Explicit Allow/Deny effects
5. **PolicyCondition** - Conditional logic for policies
6. **AssignPolicy Command** - Policy assignment to entities
7. **EvaluateAccess Command** - Access evaluation requests
8. **AccessGranted/AccessDenied Events** - Explicit access decision events
9. **GetAuditLog Query** - Audit trail retrieval

### Architecture
- Organized by DDD folders (aggregate/, commands/, events/, etc.)
- Integration with: Identity, Agent, Document, Workflow domains
- Focus on general-purpose policy evaluation

## Our Implementation (Current)

### Concepts Present
1. **Policy Evaluation Engine** - Core evaluation logic
2. **Rule Expressions** - Complex logical expressions
3. **Exemptions** - Time-bound policy exceptions
4. **Conflict Resolution** - Handling overlapping policies
5. **Template Engine** - Dynamic policy generation
6. **Severity Levels** - Graded policy violations
7. **Enforcement Levels** - Hard/Soft/Warn enforcement
8. **Composite PolicyTargets** - Multi-dimensional targets
9. **Sagas** - Multi-step policy workflows
10. **PKI-Specific Policies** (in cim-keys integration)

### Architecture
- Flat structure with services/, entities/, value_objects/
- Saga-based workflow management
- Focus on compliance and enforcement

## Concepts to Merge from GitHub Version

### 1. Claims-Based Authorization
**What it adds**: Attribute-based access control using claims
**How to integrate**: Add to our value_objects as `Claim` and `ClaimSet`

### 2. ResourcePattern
**What it adds**: Pattern matching for resource access (e.g., "/api/users/*")
**How to integrate**: Enhance our PolicyTarget with pattern matching

### 3. PolicyEffect (Allow/Deny)
**What it adds**: Explicit effect declaration instead of implicit
**How to integrate**: Add Effect enum to PolicyRule

### 4. AssignPolicy Command
**What it adds**: Explicit policy assignment to entities
**How to integrate**: Add to commands.rs with proper event generation

### 5. Access Decision Events
**What it adds**: AccessGranted/AccessDenied as first-class events
**How to integrate**: Add to events.rs for audit trail

### 6. Audit Log Queries
**What it adds**: Structured audit trail retrieval
**How to integrate**: Add query module with audit log support

## Unique Strengths of Our Implementation

1. **Saga-Based Workflows** - Complex multi-step policy processes
2. **Exemption System** - Sophisticated time-bound exceptions
3. **Conflict Resolution** - Automated handling of policy conflicts
4. **Template Engine** - Dynamic policy generation from templates
5. **Evaluation Context** - Rich context for policy evaluation
6. **Severity & Enforcement Levels** - Nuanced policy application

## Recommended Merger Strategy

1. **Keep our core architecture** - It's more sophisticated
2. **Add GitHub concepts** - Claims, ResourcePattern, Effects
3. **Enhance with missing features**:
   - Claims-based authorization system
   - Resource pattern matching
   - Explicit Allow/Deny effects
   - Structured audit logging
   - Policy assignment commands

## Implementation Priority

1. ✅ Core policy engine (complete)
2. ✅ Exemptions and conflict resolution (complete)
3. ✅ Template engine (complete)
4. ⬜ Claims-based authorization (to add)
5. ⬜ Resource pattern matching (to add)
6. ⬜ Audit log queries (to add)
7. ⬜ Policy assignment commands (to add)
